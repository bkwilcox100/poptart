# Poptart

**A free, open source AI voice keyboard that works completely offline.**

Poptart is a fork of [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy) by [CJ Pais](https://github.com/cjpais), extended with premium dictation features inspired by [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai) — while staying 100% local. Hold a hotkey, speak, and clean, formatted text appears at your cursor in whatever app you're using. No cloud, no subscription, no audio leaving your machine.

## What Poptart adds on top of Handy

Handy provides the excellent core: local speech-to-text (Whisper / Parakeet / more), push-to-talk, VAD, cross-platform text injection, history, and LLM post-processing. Poptart builds Wispr Flow–style features on that foundation:

- **Local AI formatting, ready out of the box** — a second shortcut (default `option+shift+space`) runs your dictation through a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) model (`qwen3:8b`): filler words removed, punctuation fixed, and **spoken formatting commands** applied — *"number one… number two…"* becomes a numbered list, *"quote unquote X"* becomes `"X"`. Your main shortcut stays instant and raw. Any OpenAI-compatible provider works too.
- **Command Mode with hotword** — start any dictation with *"Hey Poptart"* and the rest becomes an instruction instead of dictation. No extra hotkey, no mode switch — see [Command Mode](#command-mode) below.
- **Screen-aware context (macOS)** — commands read the focused text field through the Accessibility API, so you don't have to select text first. *"Hey Poptart, fix the grammar"* rewrites the field you're in.
- **Window-aware commands (macOS, beta)** — with nothing selected, commands also see the visible content of the frontmost window: the conversation you're reading, not just the box you're typing in. *"Hey Poptart, tell Mary I'll leave the coffee shop in five minutes"* reads the Messages thread and writes the reply.
- **App-context awareness** — the `${app}` prompt variable resolves to the app you're dictating into, so the default prompt matches tone to the target: casual in Slack, formal in Mail. (macOS)
- **Snippets** — say a trigger phrase and it expands to saved text before the AI pass. Say *"my email"*, get your address. Configured in Advanced settings alongside Handy's custom words.

All of Handy's own features (custom dictionary, translation, streaming overlay, multi-model support, etc.) are unchanged.

### What's Handy vs. what's Poptart

| Local speech-to-text (Whisper / Parakeet / more), push-to-talk, VAD | Handy |
| Text injection into any app, transcription history, custom dictionary | Handy |
| Live streaming overlay, translation, multi-model management | Handy |
| LLM post-processing framework + the dedicated formatting shortcut | Handy |
| One-step install: app-managed local AI engine + model | **Poptart** |
| Hotword Command Mode (*"Hey Poptart, …"*) | **Poptart** |
| Screen-aware + window-aware command context (Accessibility) | **Poptart** |
| Spoken formatting commands in the formatting pass (lists, quotes) | **Poptart** |
| App-aware prompt tone (`${app}`), Snippets | **Poptart** |
| Signed + notarized downloadable builds | **Poptart** |

## Dictation: fast or formatted

Two shortcuts, one trade-off — you pick per dictation:

- **`option+space` — instant.** Raw transcription typed immediately. No AI pass, no wait.
- **`option+shift+space` — formatted.** The same dictation runs through the local AI first (a second or two): spelling, punctuation, and filler fixes, spoken punctuation (*"question mark"* → `?`), spoken formatting (*"number one…"* → numbered list), and tone matched to the app you're dictating into.

One caveat: spoken directives can only be formatted if the transcription model writes them down. Parakeet (the default model) drops *"quote unquote"* as meta-speech before the AI ever sees it; Whisper-family models transcribe it literally and get the full treatment.

## Command Mode

Command Mode turns your voice into an *editor* instead of a keyboard. There is exactly one shortcut — your normal transcribe hotkey (default `option+space`). What you say decides what happens:

- Speak normally → plain dictation, typed at your cursor.
- Start with **"Hey Poptart"** (or just **"Poptart"**) → everything after the hotword is treated as an instruction and executed by the local AI.

Punctuation and casing don't matter — *"Hey Poptart,"*, *"Pop-Tart:"*, and *"pop tart"* all work, since speech models render the name differently. Saying the bare hotword with nothing after it, or words like "poptarts", stays plain dictation.

### What it operates on

Commands automatically pick the most specific text available, in this order:

1. **Your selection** — if text is selected, the instruction is applied to it and the result replaces the selection. Works in any app; on macOS the selection is read via Accessibility, elsewhere (or in apps that don't expose it) via a clipboard-preserving copy.
2. **The focused field** (macOS) — with nothing selected, the field's current text is used as context. The AI decides whether the result should *replace the field* (e.g. *"fix the typos"* rewrites it in place) or be *inserted at your cursor* (e.g. *"add a closing sentence"*).
3. **Nothing** — in an empty field, the instruction just generates text: *"Hey Poptart, write a haiku about toast."*

When there's no selection, the **visible window content** (beta) is also attached as read-only context — the window title plus the text the frontmost window exposes through Accessibility. That's what lets *"respond to the last message"* or *"tell Mary I'll be five minutes late"* work from an empty reply box: the AI can see the conversation, the sender's name, and what was just said. The window is never edited; only your reply box receives text, and nothing is sent — you always press send yourself.

### Examples

| You say | With | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Hey Poptart, make this a bulleted list" | a selected paragraph | selection becomes a list |
| "Poptart, make this more formal" | a selected sentence | selection rewritten formally |
| "Hey Poptart, fix the grammar" | cursor in a filled field, no selection | whole field rewritten in place |
| "Poptart, add a closing sentence thanking everyone" | cursor at the end of an email | sentence inserted at the cursor |
| "Hey Poptart, write a short standup update" | an empty field | text generated at the cursor |
| "Poptart, tell Mary I'll leave the coffee shop in five minutes" | empty compose box in a Messages thread | reply written from the conversation (beta) |
| "Hey Poptart, respond to the last message in this thread" | empty input under a visible conversation | context-aware reply at the cursor (beta) |

### Good to know

- Command Mode requires post-processing to be enabled (it is by default) and a reachable AI. Poptart sets up and manages its own local AI engine during onboarding and restarts it at launch when needed. If the AI can't be reached, the overlay shows **"Command failed"** and nothing is pasted; a failed command never destroys your text.
- The overlay stays visible with a working indicator while the AI generates, and your clipboard is always restored.
- Whole-field rewrites, field context, and window context are macOS-only for now; on Windows/Linux commands work on selected text via the clipboard.
- **Window awareness is beta.** It reads what apps publish through the Accessibility API — native apps (Messages, Mail, Notes) and most Electron apps work well. Apps that draw their text without exposing it to Accessibility (some games, remote desktops, canvas-rendered views) come back empty; commands there still work, just without window context. An OCR fallback for those apps hasn't been built or tested yet. Everything stays on-device — window text goes only to your local model.

## Download

**[⬇ Download the latest release](https://github.com/bkwilcox100/poptart/releases/latest)** — grab the `.dmg`, drag Poptart to Applications, and launch. That's the whole install.

- Builds are for **Apple Silicon** Macs and are signed and notarized, so macOS opens them without any Gatekeeper workarounds.
- Everything else happens in the app: onboarding walks you through permissions, picks a transcription model, and sets up the local AI (engine + model, ~5.4 GB) with one click — no Terminal, no Homebrew. Already run Ollama? Poptart detects and uses it.
- Windows and Linux users: build from source below.

## Getting started

1. Build from source (see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)) — requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) and Rust: `bun install && bun tauri build`
2. Launch, grant microphone + accessibility permissions, and pick a transcription model
3. Let onboarding's one-click **Set up local AI** handle the AI engine + model — or skip it and configure any OpenAI-compatible provider (including your own Ollama) in Post Process settings
4. Hold `option+space` and talk (instant), hold `option+shift+space` for AI-formatted dictation — or say *"Hey Poptart, …"* to give a command
